        <h2>An introduction to IFEWs</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
          The objective of this project is to develop cyber-enabled interfaces for decision support within and across spatial, political, 
          and temporal scales to balance Food-Energy-Water (FEW) constraints and tradeoffs to ensure resilience and sustainability. 
          Specifically, we use as our test case the unique situation in the Midwest, in which we deal 
          not with too little water, but too much water. With little or no need for irrigation, but with soils and topography that trend towards waterlogged 
          conditions, Iowa has invested heavily to create appropriate subsurface drainage systems (or drainage "tiles") for the abundant farm land, which 
          produces the most corn in the US, of which almost 60% is diverted to biofuels. This drained water, much of which is aggregated into larger 
          networks by "drainage districts" operated by county governments, then, with flow from the rest of the watersheds, exits into the major Iowa 
          rivers, which in turn empty into the Mississippi River.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/dead_zone_1.png" alt="">
        <p style="text-align:justify">Multiple tiers of oversight and policy are involved from municipal through federal governments, along with 
          international implications for food and biofuel availability. Figure below shows the complex relationship between Iowa farm, the physical tiers 
          of water entities, and the local through federal taxing and policy authorities. These spatial and political entities, with diverse stakeholders, 
          are connected in a variety of ways, which create a complex network resulting in unanticipated system outcomes. The FEW challenges associated 
          with our case are primarily due to the farmers' need to fertilize their fields to maximize crop yield for both biofuel and food production, and 
          the mismatch in timing between periods of high drainage water flux and nitrogen movement (early spring) and crop uptake (summer), with the 
          resulting excess nitrogen being transported through the waterways to the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a hypoxic Dead Zone - with obvious 
          detrimental environmental, societal and economic impacts. Driving much of the decision making at local levels are policies and incentives 
          implemented at higher levels and vice versa, with no real understanding of the potential unintended consequences.
